The goverment debt market is the usual data source if we want to estimate a zero-coupon yield curve for a country. Government bonds are usually the most liquid, and can be considered default-free, provided the issuing country has a good rating. We demonstrate the usage of our package with a dataset of European government bonds. Of course, a zero-coupon yield curve can also be estimated for coporate bonds. In that case, it would is interesting to compare the curve to a risk-free one and calculate the spread.

\subsection{Dynamic estimation}

In the following, we provide results for a dynamic estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve for the time between November 30, 2007 and February 1, 2008. We used the \cite{Svensson1994} method, together with duration weights and minimization of the price errors. Fig. \ref{fig:3dplot} shows how the estimated French yield curves.

Fig. \ref{fig:paramdevel} shows how the parameters evolve over time. To speed up the estimation and ensure the algorithm stays in a global minimum, the estimated parameters from the previous period were used as start parameters for the next one.
