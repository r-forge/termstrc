\section{Practical application}
\label{sec:pract-appl}

The goverment debt market is the usual data source if we want to estimate a zero-coupon yield curve for a country. Government bonds are usually the most liquid, and can be considered default-free, provided the issuing country has a good rating. We demonstrate the usage of our package with a dataset of European government bonds. Of course, a zero-coupon yield curve can also be estimated for coporate bonds. In that case, it would is interesting to compare the curve to a risk-free one and calculate the spread.
