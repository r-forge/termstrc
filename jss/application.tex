\section{Practical application}
\label{sec:pract-appl}

The goverment debt market is the common data source for estimating a zero-coupon yield curve of a country. Government bonds are usually the most liquid securities, and can be considered default-free, provided the issuing country has a good rating. We demonstrate the application of our package with a data set of European government bonds obtained from Thomson Financial Datastream. The following examples show the application of the package using the before mentioned procedures, as well as a rolling estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve.

\subsection{Rolling estimation procedure}

We now provide results of a daily rolling estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve for the time between November 30, 2007 and February 1, 2008. We use the \cite{Svensson1994} method, together with duration weights and minimization of the price errors. Figure \ref{fig:3dplot} shows the estimated French yield curves during that time period.

The estimated parameters are presented in Figure \ref{fig:paramdevel}. To speed up the estimation and ensure that the algorithm stays in a global minimum, the estimated parameters from the previous period were used as starting values for the next one.
