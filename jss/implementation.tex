\subsection{Data sets}

The data sets in our package have the following structure. They are list objects, which contain sublists for the countries available in the data set. Each of them contains market data in the format described in Table \ref{tab:dataset}.

\begin{table}[htb]

For more information see \url{http://www.datastream.com/}.} The goal is now to perform perform a zero-coupon yield curve estimation with the two procedures mentioned in Section \ref{sec:nels-svenss-meth} and \ref{sec:cubic-splines}.
