  abstract = {The success of any yield curve smoothing technique has traditionally
	been judged by the smoothness of the forward rate curve it produces.
	Intuitively, smooth forward rates seem more likely to produce more
	accurate interpolated yields than volatile forward rate curves. The
	integral of the squared second derivative of forward rates is defined
	as a mathematical measure of smoothness. Using this objective function,
	one can determine the parameters of any functional form that produces
	the smoothest forward rate curve consistent with that functional
	form and observable data. It is also shown that the smoothest forward
	rate curves are produced by a 4th-degree polynomial with the cubic
	term missing. Applying this general solution to forward rate generation,
	it is shown that the maximum smoothness approach outperforms other
	techniques when judged on the dual criteria of accuracy and smoothness.
	The maximum smoothness forward rate approach also provides a mathematical
	criterion for comparing the smoothness of the forward rates produced
	by any functional forms.},

	by which the discount rate function is built up by computingthe forward
	rate necessary to price successively longer maturitybonds. The Smoothed
	Fama-Bliss "smooths out" these discount ratesby fitting an approximating
	function to the "unsmoothed" rates.The McCulloch method fits a cubic
	spline to the discount functionusing an implicit smoothness penalty,
	while the Fisher-Nychka-Zervosmethod fits a cubic spline to the forward
	rate function and makesthe smoothness penalty explicit. Lastly, the
	Extended Nelson-Siegelmethod, introduced in this paper, fits an exponential
	approximationof the discount rate function directly to bond prices.
	; The testsdemonstrate the dangers of in-sample goodness-of-fit as
	the solecriterion for judging term structure estimation methods.
	A seriesof residual analysis tests are introduced to detect misspecificationof
	the underlying pricing equation relating the term structure tobond
	prices. These tests establish the presence of unspecified,but nonetheless
	systematic, omitted factors in the prices of longmaturity notes and

	using these parametric and non-parametric testsfinds that the Unsmoothed
	Fama-Bliss does best overall. Differenceswith some alternatives may
	not be economically significant giventhe much larger number of parameters
	this method estimates. Usersseeking a parsimonious representation
	of the term structure shouldconsider either the Smoothed Fama-Bliss
	or the Extended Nelson-Siegelmethods. One method was found to be
	unacceptable. The Fisher-Nychka-Zervoscubic spline method performs

	Our primary focus is on the interplay between the theoretical specification

	dynamic term structure models that have been fit to treasury or swap
	yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions, jump-diffusion,
	or have "switching regimes." Then the goodness-of-fit of these models
	is assessed relative to their abilities to (i) match linear projections
	of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield curve; (ii) match
	the persistence of conditional volatilities, and the shapes of term
	structures of unconditional volatilities, of yields; and (iii) to
	reliably price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income derivatives.
	For the case of defaultable securities we explore the relative fits

	comparatively little attention has been paid to the key practical

	Instead, we use variations on the Nelson-Siegel exponential components
	framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a
	three-dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the
	three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding
	to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with
	high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for
	the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety
	of stylized facts regarding the yield curve. We use our models to
	produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons,
	with encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts appear much
	more accurate at long horizons than various standard benchmark forecasts.},

	the optimal smoothness can be determined from data. For these reasons
