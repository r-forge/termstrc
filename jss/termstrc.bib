  abstract = {This paper tests and compares five distinct methods for estimatingthe
	term structure. The Unsmoothed Fama-Bliss method is an iterativemethod
	by which the discount rate function is built up by computingthe forward
	rate necessary to price successively longer maturitybonds. The Smoothed
	Fama-Bliss "smooths out" these discount ratesby fitting an approximating
	function to the "unsmoothed" rates.The McCulloch method fits a cubic
	spline to the discount functionusing an implicit smoothness penalty,
	while the Fisher-Nychka-Zervosmethod fits a cubic spline to the forward
	rate function and makesthe smoothness penalty explicit. Lastly, the
	Extended Nelson-Siegelmethod, introduced in this paper, fits an exponential
	approximationof the discount rate function directly to bond prices.
	; The testsdemonstrate the dangers of in-sample goodness-of-fit as
	the solecriterion for judging term structure estimation methods.
	A seriesof residual analysis tests are introduced to detect misspecificationof
	the underlying pricing equation relating the term structure tobond
	prices. These tests establish the presence of unspecified,but nonetheless
	systematic, omitted factors in the prices of longmaturity notes and
	bonds. ; Comparisons of the five term structureestimation methods
	using these parametric and non-parametric testsfinds that the Unsmoothed
	Fama-Bliss does best overall. Differenceswith some alternatives may
	not be economically significant giventhe much larger number of parameters
	this method estimates. Usersseeking a parsimonious representation
	of the term structure shouldconsider either the Smoothed Fama-Bliss
	or the Extended Nelson-Siegelmethods. One method was found to be
	unacceptable. The Fisher-Nychka-Zervoscubic spline method performs
	poorly relative to the alternatives,both in- and out-of-sample. Furthermore,
	it systematically mispricesshort maturity issues and suffers from
	instability in the estimatedterm structure.},

  abstract = {This article is a critical survey of models designed for pricing fixed-income
	securities and their associated term structures of market yields.
	Our primary focus is on the interplay between the theoretical specification
	of dynamic term structure models and their empirical fit to historical
	changes in the shapes of yield curves. We begin by overviewing the
	dynamic term structure models that have been fit to treasury or swap
	yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions, jump-diffusion,
	or have "switching regimes." Then the goodness-of-fit of these models
	is assessed relative to their abilities to (i) match linear projections
	of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield curve; (ii) match
	the persistence of conditional volatilities, and the shapes of term
	structures of unconditional volatilities, of yields; and (iii) to
	reliably price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income derivatives.
	For the case of defaultable securities we explore the relative fits
	to historical yield spreads.},
