\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented the \proglang{R} extension package \pkg{termstrc}. It provides functions for the estimation of zero-coupon yield curves from market data of coupon bonds. The package covers the two most widely-used approaches in practice and provides a simple interface to them. The results contain detailed summaries about the estimation, as well as graphical outputs of spot, forward and credit spread curves.
