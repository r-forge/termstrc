Title: Zero-coupon Yield Curve Estimation
Version: 1.2

Author: Robert Ferstl, Josef Hayden

Description: The package offers parametric and spline-based methods for the estimation of zero-coupon yield curves out of observed coupon bond data and zero yields. The methods include Nelson and Siegel (1987), Svensson (1994), Diebold/Li (2006) and the cubic splies approach of McCulloch (1975). Functions for the iterative estimation of the term structue based on a dynamic bond or yield data set are included. Extensive summary statistics and plots are provided to compare the results of the different estimation methods.
