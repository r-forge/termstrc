@techreport{Bliss1996,
	Abstract = {This paper tests and compares five distinct methods for estimatingthe
	term structure. The Unsmoothed Fama-Bliss method is an iterativemethod
	by which the discount rate function is built up by computingthe
	forward rate necessary to price successively longer maturitybonds.
	The Smoothed Fama-Bliss "smooths out" these discount ratesby fitting
	an approximating function to the "unsmoothed" rates.The McCulloch
	method fits a cubic spline to the discount functionusing an implicit
	smoothness penalty, while the Fisher-Nychka-Zervosmethod fits a
	cubic spline to the forward rate function and makesthe smoothness
	penalty explicit. Lastly, the Extended Nelson-Siegelmethod, introduced
	in this paper, fits an exponential approximationof the discount
	rate function directly to bond prices. ; The testsdemonstrate the
	dangers of in-sample goodness-of-fit as the solecriterion for judging
	term structure estimation methods. A seriesof residual analysis
	tests are introduced to detect misspecificationof the underlying
	pricing equation relating the term structure tobond prices. These
	tests establish the presence of unspecified,but nonetheless systematic,
	omitted factors in the prices of longmaturity notes and bonds. ;
	Comparisons of the five term structureestimation methods using these
	parametric and non-parametric testsfinds that the Unsmoothed Fama-Bliss
	does best overall. Differenceswith some alternatives may not be
	economically significant giventhe much larger number of parameters
	this method estimates. Usersseeking a parsimonious representation
	of the term structure shouldconsider either the Smoothed Fama-Bliss
	or the Extended Nelson-Siegelmethods. One method was found to be
	unacceptable. The Fisher-Nychka-Zervoscubic spline method performs
	poorly relative to the alternatives,both in- and out-of-sample.
	Furthermore, it systematically mispricesshort maturity issues and
	suffers from instability in the estimatedterm structure.},

@article{Dai2003,
	Abstract = {This article is a critical survey of models designed for pricing fixed-income
	securities and their associated term structures of market yields.
	Our primary focus is on the interplay between the theoretical specification
	of dynamic term structure models and their empirical fit to historical
	changes in the shapes of yield curves. We begin by overviewing the
	dynamic term structure models that have been fit to treasury or
	swap yield curves and in which the risk factors follow diffusions,
	jump-diffusion, or have "switching regimes." Then the goodness-of-fit
	of these models is assessed relative to their abilities to (i) match
	linear projections of changes in yields onto the slope of the yield
	curve; (ii) match the persistence of conditional volatilities, and
	the shapes of term structures of unconditional volatilities, of
	yields; and (iii) to reliably price caps, swaptions, and other fixed-income
	derivatives. For the case of defaultable securities we explore the
	relative fits to historical yield spreads.},

@article{Nelson1987,
	Abstract = {A parametrically parsimonious model, motivated by but not dependentupon
	the expectations theory of the term structure, is introducedfor
	yield curves. The model is able to represent the shapes generallyassociated
	with yield curves: monotonic, humped, and S-shaped. Thedata were
	obtained from Federal Reserve Bank of New York quote sheetssampled
	on every 4th Thursday (excluding holidays) during January22, 1981-October
	27, 1983, for a total of 37 samples. It is foundthat the model explains
	96% of the variation in US Treasury billyields across maturities
	during the study period. The movement ofthe parameters through time
	reflects and verifies a change in FederalReserve monetary policy
	in late 1982. The ability of the fittedcurves to predict the price
	of the long-term Treasury bond witha correlation of .96 indicates
	that the model captures importantattributes of the yield-maturity
	relation. Potential applicationsof parsimonious yield curve models
